 * <h2>Features</h2>
 * - EXternal devices (EX) supporting numerous devices external to the MCU
 *   abstracting common devices which are part of modern embedded systems.
 * - EX resides on top of HAL which offers, among others, a set of abstract 
 *   interfaces like Generic Sensor, Gyroscope, Magnetometer, Accelerometer,
 *   Barometer, Thermometer: EX offers a phisical implementation of them.
