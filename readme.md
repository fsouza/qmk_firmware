This purpose of this fork is maintain a clean repo that only contains the keyboard code that we need, and as little else as possible.  This is to keep it lightweight, since we only need a couple of keyboards. This is the repo that the EZ Configurator will pull from.

You can request changes by making a fork and opening a [pull request](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pulls), or by clicking the "Edit this page" link at the bottom of any page.


## Supported Keyboards

* [ErgoDox EZ](/keyboards/ergodox_ez/)
* [Planck EZ](/keyboards/planck/ez)
* [Moonlander Mark I](/keyboards/moonlander)

## Building

To set up the local build enviroment to create the firmware image manually, head to the [Newbs guide from QMK](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs).
And instead of using just `qmk setup`, you will want to run this instead:

```sh
qmk setup zsa/qmk_firmware -b firmware22
```

## Maintainers

QMK is developed and maintained by Jack Humbert of OLKB with contributions from the community, and of course, [Hasu](https://github.com/tmk). The OLKB product firmwares are maintained by [Jack Humbert](https://github.com/jackhumbert), the Ergodox EZ by [ZSA Technology Labs](https://github.com/zsa), the Clueboard by [Zach White](https://github.com/skullydazed), and the Atreus by [Phil Hagelberg](https://github.com/technomancy).

# Update Process

1. Check out branch from ZSA's master branch:
    1. `git remote add zsa https://github.com/zsa/qmk_firmware.git`
    2. `git fetch --all`
    3. `git checkout -B branchname zsa/master`
    4. `git push -u zsa branchname`
2. Check for core changes:
    - [https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/commits/master/quantum](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/commits/master/quantum)
    - [https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/commits/master/tmk_core](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/commits/master/tmk_core)
    - [https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/commits/master/util](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/commits/master/util)
    - [https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/commits/master/drivers](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/commits/master/drivers)
    - [https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/commits/master/lib](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/commits/master/lib)
    - These folders are the important ones for maintaining the repo and keeping it properly up to date. Most, but not all, changes on this list should be pulled into our repo.
4. `git merge (hash|tag)`
    - `git rm -rf docs users layouts .vscode` to remove the docs and user code that we don't want.
    - To remove all of the keyboard exept the ones we want:
      ```sh
      find ./keyboards -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d -not -name ergodox_ez -not -name planck -not -name moonlander -not -name pytest -exec git rm -rf '{}' \;
      find ./keyboards/planck -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d -not -name ez -not -name base -not -name keymaps -exec git rm -rf '{}' \;
      ```
    - To remove all of the keymaps from folder that we don't want:
      ```sh
      find ./keyboards/ -mindepth 3 -maxdepth 3 -type d -not -name default -not -name oryx -not -name webusb -not -name glow -not -name reactive -not -name shine -not -name keymaps -exec git rm -rf '{}' \;
      ```
    - Restore necessary files/folders:
      ```sh
      git checkout HEAD -- keyboards/handwired/pytest
      git checkout HEAD -- layouts
      ```
    - Resolve merge conflicts, and commit.

4. Commit update
   * Include commit info in `[changelog.md](changelog.md)`
5. Open Pull request, and include information about the commit

## Strategy

To keep PRs small and easier to test, they should ideally be 1:1 with commits from QMK Firmware master. They should only group commits if/when it makes sense. Such as multiple commits for a specific feature (split RGB support, for instance)
