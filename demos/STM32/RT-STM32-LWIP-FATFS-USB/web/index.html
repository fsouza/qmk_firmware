<h2>ChibiOS - lwIP - FatFS Integration Page</h2>
<p>This demo integrates ChibiOS/RT, lwIP and FatFS in a single application.
In addition a control shell is available on a virtual com port accessible
via USB. All components are integrated using "bindings" available in the ChibiOS
source tree, the "glue" code is very small consisting of just the application
main.c file.</p>
<p>You can easily create your own web site by loading the site files on the SD
card. All files are served statically, there is no server-side scripting
support in this demo.</p>
